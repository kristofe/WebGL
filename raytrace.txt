w = normalize(vec4(u-0.5, .5-v,-focallen,0));  //u and v [-0.5,0.5]
v = vec4(0.,0.,focallength,1.0);



Calcutlating Reflection Direction
w is incoming ray
s is hit point
n is normal

reflection dir = 2(-w dot n) n + w;

v prime = s + epsilon * reflection dir
w prime = reflection dir


for shadows:
light direction points towards lights
v prime = s + epsilon * light direction
w prim = light direction
